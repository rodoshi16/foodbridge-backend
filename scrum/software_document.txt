Backend logic:

- uses GetMapping API to display hardcoded list of maps provided by a method in a JSON
format

Library usage: Leaflet VS Google maps API

- Leaflet is a react library which is free to use
- map is not modular and not very accurate
- Google maps API charges after $200 worth of credits
