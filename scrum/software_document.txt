Backend logic:

- uses GetMapping API to display hardcoded list of maps provided by a method in a JSON
format

Library usage: Leaflet VS Google maps API


- Leaflet is a React library which is free to use
- map is not modular and not very accurate
- Google maps API charges after $200 worth of credits


Breakdown of technologies used:

** @RestController -> defines the API endpoints using SpringBoot
It listens for requests from the frontend and processes them to fetch food bank locations

** @CrossOrigin -> allows Cross origin resource sharing.
Since backend and frontend are on different ports, I enabled CORS so that the frontend can make
API requests without security restrictions.

** @GetMapping -> sends a GET request to the Google maps api to retrieve information about FoodBanks
** @RequestParam -> extracts lat, lng and radius from the API request

When the frontend requests FoodBanks, it sends latitude, longitude and radius to this API endpoint. This method then
processes the request and returns the nearby FoodBanks.

RestTemplate -> built in Spring boot class that sends HTTP requests and receives responses
It is used to call Google Maps API to fetch food bank locations based on lat, lng and Radius

in the getFoodBank method, I am making a list of Map objects which have string and data inside it,
get the name, vicinity, lat and lng and turn into FoodBank objects and store them


MVC Architecture -> Model View Controller

- an architecture used when creating an application to make it cleaner

** Controller -> handles user requests and pass them to view
** View -> renders the model and generate HTML output that client interacts with
*** Model -> encapsulates the application data


In my project,

-> MapController : handling GET requests and getting info from Google Maps API and user's location and sending
to the view
-> View -> React frontend
-> Model -> MapData, FoodBankData -> uses the information retrieved as objects, hides direct access to foodbank details


Tomcat -> webserver used to run Java based applications. Tomcat is handling and processing HTTP requests from the frontend
When I run my spring application, Tomcat is automatically initialized.

Frontend breakdown:

** useLoadScript -> using this hook to load the Google Maps API on my project
** useState -> using 3 of these hooks to store the center, location and foodbanks and dynamically update it
** useEffect

- using one useEffect hook to get the user's geolocation and store the lat, lng as coordinates, u
updating the new location.
- another useEffect hook is used to fetchFoodbanks, it sends the request to the backend
and gets the foodbanks within 5km radius.
- it centers the map on a certain width and height and uses markers to mark the foodbanks on the map


Purpose: connect places where food is a need to where food is wasted
Map shows you where all the
