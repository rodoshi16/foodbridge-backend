***What is spring boot?***

It is a Java framework (a collection of pre written code) that makes building web applications easier.

***The problem spring boot solves***

Without spring boot, we would have to manually configure a web server, write lots of configuration code, set up database connections
manually and write boilerplate code for common tasks

Spring boot obviously does all of this for us

***Decorators we must understand***

***1.@SpringBootApplication**
- Spring boot needs this decorator to identify the main application class
- Spring boot will then start a web server when the code with this decorator is run
- It will scan all the code and set everything up automatically
