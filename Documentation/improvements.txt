Addition of Rest Template configuration:

Spring Boot creates a single RestTemplate instance (singleton bean) with connection pooling
The controller receives the same RestTemplate instance via constructor injection
Connections are reused instead of creating new ones each time
Connection pooling: 100 max total connections, 20 per route
Timeouts configured: 5 seconds for connect and read
